## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Well, I was able to learn the correct hierachy when styling interactive elements when working on this project.

```css
input[type="button"]:hover {
  background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 70%);
}
input[type="button"]:active {
  background-color: hsl(252, 100%, 77%);
}
```

### Continued development

I am still going to focus on html and css and flexbox for now.
